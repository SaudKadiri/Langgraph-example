# LangGraph Example



This is an example agent using LangGraph.

[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. The main use cases for LangGraph are conversational agents, and long-running, multi-step LLM applications or any LLM application that would benefit from built-in support for persistent checkpoints, cycles and human-in-the-loop interactions (ie. LLM and human collaboration).
